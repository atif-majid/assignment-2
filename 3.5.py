'''
3.5 Write a program that prints the following patterns separately, one below the other 
each pat- tern separated from the next by one blank line. Use for loops to generate the
patterns. All asterisks (*) should be printed by a single statement of the form
print '*',
(which causes the asterisks to print side by side separated by a space). (Hint: The last two 
patterns require that each line begin with an appropriate number of blanks.) Extra credit: 
Combine your code from the four separate problems into a single program that prints all four 
patterns side by side by making clever use of nested for loops. For all parts of this programâ€”minimize 
the numbers of asterisks and spaces and the number of statements that print these characters.
a) Half pyramid
b)Left Half Pyramid
c) Inverted half pyramid 
d)Full inverted Pyramid
